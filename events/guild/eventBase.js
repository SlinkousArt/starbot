    // Every file run through the events folder(s) is named after the event it is running. 
    // That is how events get thier functionality. 
    // They are ran via client.on 

    // This command wont do anything, as it is not named after an actual event!

    // You can find a list of events here:
    // https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client?scrollTo=e-channelCreate.

// All the code in this is easy editable!
